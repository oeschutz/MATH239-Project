        <h3> About the Project </h3>
        <p>
          We used the 2021 Fall Data CHallenge dataset, which has a variety of variables that include population, vehicle access, 
          and distance from the nearest grocery store among others. This data is interesting since we will be able to look at 
          low income households grocery store proximity and their accessibility to food. 

          Our group came up with three core questions:
          <ul>
            <li>Can a low income household a mile away from the nearest grocery store have a higher chance of needing SNAP benefits?</li>
            <li>How does vehicle access affect the number of households receiving SNAP benefits?</li>
            <li>How can you predict whether a census tract is classified as low access or not?</li>
          </ul>

          We used ANOVA, linear regression, t-tests, and classification trees for this project.

        <h3> Analysis and Results </h3>
        <p>
          We found that vehicle access does have an effect on the relationship between low income population and number of people 
          receiving SNAP benefits. The relationship was significant with parallel lines, but not with different slopes when using a t-test.
          
          We also attempted to use whether or not a tract was urban as a categorical predictor, but that had an insignificant effect 
          on the intercept of the regression line.
          
          It is possible to predict whether a tract is considered low access using the median family income in that tract, 
          the total Black population in that tract, and the poverty rate of that tract, with an error rate of only 1.94%.
